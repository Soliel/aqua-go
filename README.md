# aqua-go
A Discord bot skeleton written in Go

### What is Aqua?
Aqua is a bot skeleton that serves as the base for all the bots I create. It usually includes a basic command interpreter and events support.

### Why aqua-go?
I'm using this as an opportunity to learn Golang and the Javascript version of this has reached a level of staleness that would be hard to pick up again and work on.
